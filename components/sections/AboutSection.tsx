          <p>
            GrayGhost Labs is a one-person &quot;lab&quot; that combines fire
            service experience, macro analysis, crypto markets, and sports
            analytics into a collection of tools that actually try to solve real
            problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            There&apos;s no paid shilling here. No &quot;10x your net worth&quot;
            nonsense. No subscription funnel (at least not yet). Just tools,
            transparency, and the occasional model that might actually work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything here is built first for personal use, then shared publicly
            because if it&apos;s useful to one stubborn firefighter, it might be
            useful to others who think numbers beat vibes.
